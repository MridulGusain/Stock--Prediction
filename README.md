# Stock Trend Prediction

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts stock price trends using historical data from Yahoo Finance and a pre-trained LSTM model. It visualizes closing prices, moving averages (100MA and 200MA), and predicted stock prices compared to actual prices.

## Features
- Fetches historical stock data for a user-specified ticker (default: AAPL) from 2010 to 2024.
- Displays data summary and visualizations (closing price, 100MA, 200MA).
- Uses an LSTM model to predict future stock prices based on historical closing prices.
- Shows prediction metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE) for model evaluation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git installed (to manage version control)
- A virtual environment (recommended, e.g., `.venv/`)
